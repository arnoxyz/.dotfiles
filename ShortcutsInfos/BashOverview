Good-Practice:
strg +
	END and ANFANG:

strg + -> letter
alt +  -> word
	FORWARD and BACKWARD

strg + Delete letter
alt + Delte word

strg + Kill Line


strg + R (reverse search history)

Important new shit: 
sudo !! - reruns prv command with sudo
strg+d = kills current 
strg+k = kill current trough the end
strg+u = 
strg+w = delete line
strg+y = yank (contains last thing you cut)
